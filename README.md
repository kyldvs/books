### Series Rankings

These are rough rankings of the series I've read:

**If you are just getting into fantasy, I do not recommend following this list. See the getting started ranking below.**

1. The Wheel of Time (Fantasy, very long and epic series) [complete]
2. Kingkiller Chronicles (Fantasy, great storytelling) [incomplete]
3. Mistborn 1-3 (Cosmere, Fantasy, explores unique magic systems) [complete]
4. King's Dark Tidings (Fantasy, main charachter is interesting) [incomplete]
5. Spellmonger (Fantasy, planned to be very long, first few are slow, interesting and complex magic system) [incomplete]
6. Stormlight Archive (Cosmere, Fantasy) [incomplete]
7. Three Body (Sci-fi, very thought provoking, nothing too outlandish/crazy with respect to technology) [complete]
8. Arcane Ascension (Fantasy, This one was really good, but the series is young!) [incomplete]
9. Codex Alera (Fantasy, Lots of cool problem solving in this one) [complete]
10. Dresden Files (Modern/Urban Fantasy, Fast-paced easy to read books. Lots of action.) [incomplete]
11. A Pattern of Shadow and Light (Fantasy) [incomplete]
12. Bobiverse (Sci-fi, cool writing style and explores interesting concepts) [complete]

### Getting Started (Fantasy)

1. Dresden Files (A nice, fast-paced, action-packed intro to fantasy)
2. Mistborn 1-3 (This series is more firmly in the "High Fantasy" genre, very interesting and well written)
3. Continue with other Cosmere series / Kingkiller Chronicles / King's Dark Tidings (any or all of these are good options)
4. The Wheel of Time (This series is very good, but is long and can be hard to get through. Not recommended to start with.)

### Unranked Series

- The Broken Earth (Fantasy, Good series, but not sure where it fits in yet) [complete]
- The Cycle of Arawn (Fantasy, Don't remember this one well enough, I believe it was in the good/very-good range) [complete]
- The Expanse (Sci-fi, have had trouble getting through these. Stuck around book 5, but many people like them) [incomplete]
- The Reckoners (Modern/Urban Fantasy, Good Brandon Sanderson series, more super-hero than fantasy)
- The Cinder Spires (Fantasy, Don't remember this one well) [incomplete]
