# Rankings

Different lists and rankings for series I've read.

## Fantasy - Getting Started

This is a nice ordering of series for someone getting started in the Fantasy genre. Recommendations 2-5 can all be mixed around, they will be similar.

- 1 - [The Dresden Files](./fiction/fantasy/dresden-files.md)
  - Modern/Urban Fantasy, Fast-paced easy to read books. Lots of action.
- 2 - [Mistborn (1-3)](./fiction/fantasy/mistborn.md)
  - Very interesting magic system.
  - Stronger fantasy elements than _The Dresden Files_. More of a focus on magic.
- 3 - [King's Dark Tidings](./fiction/fantasy/kings-dark-tidings.md)
  - A well written series with a lot of mystery and great characters.
  - The main character is powerful, and has many things to uncover.
- 4 - [The Kingkiller Chronicle](./fiction/fantasy/kingkiller-chronicle.md)
  - Fantastic writing and story telling.
  - A telling of a hero's past and how he grew up. Largely set in a magical school.
- 5 - Continue with others in the [Cosmere Universe by Brandon Sanderson](./authors.md#brandon-sanderson)
- 6 - [The Wheel of Time](./fiction/fantasy/wheel-of-time.md)
  - This is my favorite epic-fantasy series. It is excellent overall, but is long and can be hard to get through.
  - I would only recommend this after getting through some of the previously mentioned series.

## Fiction - Overall

My overall rankings for fiction books / series. Anything on this list I would **strongly recommend**. Being at the bottom does not mean the book is bad! These are rough, relative rankings of books I've enjoyed.

- 1 - [The Wheel of Time](./fiction/fantasy/wheel-of-time.md)
- 2 - [The Kingkiller Chronicle](./fiction/fantasy/kingkiller-chronicle.md)
- 3 - [Mistborn (1-3)](./fiction/fantasy/mistborn.md)
- 4 - [King's Dark Tidings](./fiction/fantasy/kings-dark-tidings.md)
- 5 - [The Spellmonger](./fiction/fantasy/spellmonger.md)
  - Planned to be a very long series.
  - Interesting and complex magic system and great world building. First few books take a while to introduce the magic system.
- 6 - [Stormlight Archive](./fiction/fantasy/stormlight-archive.md)
- 7 - [Three Body](./fiction/sci-fi/three-body.md)
  - Sci-fi, very thought provoking. Explores the Fermi Paradox.
- 8 - [Arcane Ascension](./fiction/fantasy/arcane-ascension.md)
  - Almost fits in the LitRPG genre. It's a very fun series, and a good way to see if you'd like LitRPG.

  - Lots of cool problem solving in this one.
- 10 - [The Dresden Files](./fiction/fantasy/dresden-files.md)

### Unranked Series (TODO)

- The Broken Earth (Fantasy, Good series, but not sure where it fits in yet)
- The Cycle of Arawn (Fantasy, Don't remember this one well enough, I believe it was in the good/very-good range)
- The Expanse (Sci-fi, have had trouble getting through these. Stuck around book 5, but many people like them)
- The Reckoners (Modern/Urban Fantasy, Good Brandon Sanderson series, more super-hero than fantasy)
- The Cinder Spires (Fantasy, Don't remember this one well)
