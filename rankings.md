# Rankings

These are rough rankings of the series I've read.

## Fantasy - Getting Started

- 1 - [The Dresden Files](./fiction/fantasy/dresden-files.md)
  - A wizard going around Chicago solving crimes.
  - Nice, fast-paced, action-packed intro to fantasy.
  - Lots of short books.
- 2 - [Mistborn (1-3)](./fiction/fantasy/mistborn.md)
  - Very interesting magic system.
  - Stronger fantasy elements than _The Dresden Files_. More of a focus on magic.
- 3 - [King's Dark Tidings](./fiction/fantasy/kings-dark-tidings.md)
  - A well written series with a lot of mystery and great characters.
  - The main character is powerful, and has many things to uncover.
- 4 - [The Kingkiller Chronicle](./fiction/fantasy/kingkiller-chronicle.md)
  - Fantastic writing and story telling.
  - A telling of a hero's past and how he grew up. Largely set in a magical school.
- 5 - Continue with others in the [Cosmere Universe by Brandon Sanderson](./authors.md#brandon-sanderson)
- 6 - [The Wheel of Time](./fiction/fantasy/wheel-of-time.md)
  - This is my favorite epic-fantasy series. It is excellent overall, but is long and can be hard to get through.
  - I would only recommend this after getting through some of the previously mentioned series.

## Fiction - Overall

1. The Wheel of Time (Fantasy, very long and epic series)
2. Kingkiller Chronicles (Fantasy, great storytelling)
3. Mistborn 1-3 (Cosmere, Fantasy, explores unique magic systems)
4. King's Dark Tidings (Fantasy, main charachter is interesting)
5. Spellmonger (Fantasy, planned to be very long, first few are slow, interesting and complex magic system)
6. Stormlight Archive (Cosmere, Fantasy)
7. Three Body (Sci-fi, very thought provoking, nothing too outlandish/crazy with respect to technology)
8. Arcane Ascension (Fantasy, This one was really good, but the series is young!)
9. Codex Alera (Fantasy, Lots of cool problem solving in this one)
10. Dresden Files (Modern/Urban Fantasy, Fast-paced easy to read books. Lots of action.)
11. A Pattern of Shadow and Light (Fantasy)
12. Bobiverse (Sci-fi, cool writing style and explores interesting concepts)

### Unranked Series (TODO)

- The Broken Earth (Fantasy, Good series, but not sure where it fits in yet)
- The Cycle of Arawn (Fantasy, Don't remember this one well enough, I believe it was in the good/very-good range)
- The Expanse (Sci-fi, have had trouble getting through these. Stuck around book 5, but many people like them)
- The Reckoners (Modern/Urban Fantasy, Good Brandon Sanderson series, more super-hero than fantasy)
- The Cinder Spires (Fantasy, Don't remember this one well)
